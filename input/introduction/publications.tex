\item [\textbf{Abstract:}] Distributed collaborative editing systems allow users
  to work distributed in time, space and across organizations. Trending
  distributed collaborative editors such as Google Docs, Etherpad or Git have
  grown in popularity over the years. A new kind of distributed editors based on
  a family of distributed data structure replicated on several sites called
  Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT for short) appeared recently. This
  paper considers a CRDT that represents a distributed sequence of basic
  elements that can be lines, words or characters (sequence CRDT). The possible
  operations on this sequence are the insertion and the deletion of
  elements. Compared to the state of the art, this approach is more
  decentralized and better scales in terms of the number of
  participants. However, its space complexity is linear with respect to the
  total number of inserts and the insertion points in the document. This makes
  the overall performance of such editors dependent on the editing behaviour of
  users. This paper proposes and models \LSEQ, an adaptive allocation strategy
  for a sequence CRDT. \LSEQ achieves in the average a sub-linear spatial
  complexity whatever is the editing behaviour. Series of experiments validate
  \LSEQ showing that it outperforms existing approaches.

\item [Concurrency Effects Over Variable-size Identifiers in Distributed 
  Collaborative Editing]
\item [Brice Nédelec, Pascal Molli, Achour Mostefaoui, and Emmanuel Desmontils]
\item [\textbf{Abstract:}] Distributed collaborative editors such as Google Docs
  or Etherpad allow to distribute the work across time, space and
  organizations. In this paper, we focus on distributed collaborative editors
  based on the Conflict-free Replicated Data Type approach (CRDT). CRDTs
  encompass a set of well-known data types (sets, graphs, sequences,
  etc.). CRDTs for sequences model a document as a set of elements (character,
  line, paragraph, etc.) with unique identifiers, providing two commutative
  update operations: insert and delete. The identifiers of elements can be
  either of fixed-size or variable-size. Recently, a strategy for assigning
  variable-size identifiers called \LSEQ has been proposed for CRDTs for
  sequences. \LSEQ lowers the space complexity of variable-size identifiers
  CRDTs from linear to sub-linear. While experiments show that it works locally,
  it fails to provide this bound with multiple users and latency. In this paper,
  we propose $h$-\LSEQ, an improvement of \LSEQ that preserves its space
  complexity among all collaborators, regardless of the latency. Ultimately,
  this improvement allows to safely build distributed collaborative editors
  based on CRDTs. We validate our approach with simulations involving latency
  and multiple users.
